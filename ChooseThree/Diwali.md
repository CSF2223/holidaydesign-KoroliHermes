### Diwali, India
Hindus celebrate Diwali, a major five-day festival of lights thatâ€™s observed in fall (the date is different every year).
The ancient holiday, found in Sanskrit texts, celebrates good over evil and light over darkness. As such, the holiday is filled with all manner of light,
from candles to firecrackers. Other traditions involve honoring the Hindu deity Lakshmi, who represents wealth, and creating rangoli, elaborate colorful
patterns made with paint, flowers, chalk, rice, sand and more. Gift giving is another huge part of the holiday (particularly anything gold), as are endless feasts.
Sweets are also key, like gulab jamun (fried balls soaked in rose-water syrup) and barfi (solid squares made of condensed milk and sugar and flavored with everything
from pistachios to cardamom).
