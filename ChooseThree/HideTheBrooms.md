### Hide The Brooms (Norway)

Some Norwegians believe witches and evil spirits roam the night sky on Christmas Eve. And what is a witchâ€™s preferred mode of transportation?
A broomstick. So out of an abundance of caution, people in Norway hide all of the brooms in their houses to prevent any witches from getting
their hands on them. Sometimes people will take it a step further by firing a warning gunshot into the air to scare them off.
