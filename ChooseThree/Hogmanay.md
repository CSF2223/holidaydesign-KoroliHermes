### Hogmanay, Scotland
Hogmanay is a raging New Yearâ€™s Eve bash with massive parties that last until January 2nd. The holiday evolved from celebrating the winter solstice
and incorporated elements from Samhain, an ancient Gaelic holiday most akin to Halloween, which is still celebrated today. Edinburgh plays host to
the largest Hogmanay, starting with a massive torchlight procession on Dec. 30th. Yes, actual fire is involved, as are drummers and bagpipers
(because, Scotland).
