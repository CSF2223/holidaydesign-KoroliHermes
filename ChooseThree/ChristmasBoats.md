### Christmas Boats, Greece
Christmas trees are popular in Greece, but you’ll also find boats wrapped in strings of lights, whether in the water or in the main square.
There are two explanations for the boat-decorating phenomenon: The first is that the country’s ancient maritime tradition means boats have always
been an integral part of the culture, so they were decorated long before a modernized version of Christmas (including trees) came along.
The second is that St. Nicholas is considered the patron saint of sailors, which is probably why boats are decorated on December 6th.
