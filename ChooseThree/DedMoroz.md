### Ded Moroz, Russia
While much of the world’s Christian community embraces Santa Claus or St. Nick, Russians welcome Ded Moroz each year, an ancient figure
from Slavic mythology. Also called Father Frost, the Santa-like character brings gifts to children, except he delivers them on New Year’s Eve.
(This stems from the Bolshevik Revolution when the government banned anything religious, including Christmas.) Ded Moroz traditionally wears a
full-length blue coat, so as not to be confused with Santa, and is accompanied by his granddaughter, Snegurochka, or Snow Maiden. Even though
it's become more common for Ded Moroz to wear red, he maintains the tradition of carrying a staff and riding in a sleigh pulled by three white horses.
