### Simbang Gabi, Philippines
The Philippines are home to Asia’s largest Christian community, and it’s here that you’ll find the nine-day Simbang Gabi,
a series of pre-dawn Catholic Masses that culminate on Christmas Eve. Waking up before sunrise may not sound like fun,
but this is offset with a festive atmosphere en route to services, with lively bands and colorful lanterns lighting the way.
Street vendors also rise early to sell the popular puto bumbong, a purple sticky rice cake, and bibingka, a coconut milk-based rice cake.
