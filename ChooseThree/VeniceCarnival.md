Venice Carnival, Italy
Carnival traditions vary widely around the world, from Mardi Gras in New Orleans to the Samba parades in Rio de Janeiro. In Venice, Carnival is all
about the masked costume balls. The most in-demand ones like the famous Il Ballo del Doge, the official dinner at Ca 'Vendramin Calergi and the popular
Casanova Grand Ball, tend to be prohibitively expensive and sell out quickly, but there are plenty of free events in addition to the balls.
As for the backstory, Venice Carnival is tied to a 12th-century Catholic custom that likely evolved from winter solstice practices and marked a period of
full-out debauchery before the no-fun season of Lent began. However, it can be argued that plenty of debauchery can still be found today during the two
weeks in February leading up to Lent.
