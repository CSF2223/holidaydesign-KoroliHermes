### Dōngzhì Festival, China
The Dōngzhì Festival is China's take on winter solstice, although the festival is also observed in Korea, Vietnam and more.
In modern times, the Chinese New Year has overshadowed winter solstice, since the more popular spring festival occurs just six weeks later.
As such, the winter solstice is no longer a public holiday in China, but many families still continue the practice, which entails paying
homage to ancestors and eating tangyuan (sticky rice balls in sweet soup).
