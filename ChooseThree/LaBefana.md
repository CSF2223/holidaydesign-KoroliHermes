### The Gift-Giving Witch (Italy)

Speaking of witches, the Italian version of Santa Claus is an ugly (but kind) old witch called La Befana. As the story goes, the Magi stopped
at her house to ask for directions on their way to visit baby Jesus. They invited Befana to come with them on their journey, but she said she
had too much housework to do. After they left, she changed her mind and tried to find them but couldn’t, so now she flies around on the night
of January 5 (the eve of the Epiphany, which marks the Magi’s meeting with Baby Jesus). Much like Santa, La Befana delivers toys to children.
Instead of milk and cookies, Italians leave out a plate of sausage and broccoli and a glass of wine for her.
