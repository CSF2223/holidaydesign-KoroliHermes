### Dead Horse Caroling (Wales)

You’re probably familiar with Christmas caroling, but you’re definitely not familiar with the carolers who might show up at your door in Wales.
At some point in December or January, you could open your door to find someone hidden by a ribbon and bell-adorned sheet, holding up a real horse
skull on a stick, with a few fellow revelers in tow. As part of this Mari Lwyd (“Gray Mare”) tradition, the group will sing to you and then challenge
you to a battle of rhyming insults in Welsh (called a pwnco). After the contest, the party is usually invited inside for refreshments.
