### Christmas Pudding, U.K.
This beloved British tradition, also called plum pudding, actually dates back to the Middle Ages. The name is a misnomer though,
since the original version didn’t involve plums, and the consistency is believed to have been more akin to stew than pudding.
Oh, and it wasn’t a dessert either, but a savory meat-based affair that involved dried fruit. By Victorian times, the Christmas pudding
evolved into today’s familiar fruit-based version, as detailed in Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol. To get the full traditional
experience, a proper Christmas pudding conceals a silver sixpence (or any coin) for good luck. Upon serving, the dark brown ball is soaked
in brandy, then set alight.
