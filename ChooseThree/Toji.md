### Toji, Japan
Japan’s winter solstice is known as Toji, a low-key tradition that involves lighting bonfires on Mt. Fuji and soaking in citrus-scented baths.
But arguably, the best way to welcome the winter solstice is by visiting an onsen (a natural hot spring) that’s filled with yuzu for the occasion.
Fun fact: Yuzu is a type of sour citrus fruit that looks like a lemon, but tastes more like a lime.
