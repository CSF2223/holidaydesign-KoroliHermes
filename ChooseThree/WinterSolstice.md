### Winter Solstice, U.K.
Winter Solstice is an ancient tradition — possibly dating as far back as the Stone Age — that observes the shortest day of the year.
This occurs a few days before Christmas, and even though it’s celebrated in different forms everywhere from Sweden to Iran, England's
Stonehenge is thought to be one of the earliest epicenters for marking the longest night of the year due to the placement of the stones.
In fact, the Winter Solstice is still celebrated at Stonehenge, and anyone can buy tickets to experience the sunrise, along with Druid
and Pagan traditions.
