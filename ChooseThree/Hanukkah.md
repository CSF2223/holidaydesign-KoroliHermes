### Hanukkah

Every year, Jewish families around the world gather to celebrate Hanukkah. The holiday commemorates the miraculous longevity
of a small quantity of oil that kept the menorah in the Second Temple in Jerusalem lit after it was reclaimed from invaders during an ancient battle.
Though there was only enough oil to last for one day, it stayed lit for eight.

In remembrance, Jews worldwide light menorahs for eight days every Hanukkah to celebrate. Families give gifts, play games of dreidel,
and enjoy special foods all over the world: sufganiyot jelly donuts in Israel, latke potato pancakes in Eastern Europe, fried plantain
patacones in Colombia, and more!
