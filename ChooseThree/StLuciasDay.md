### St. Lucia's Day

St. Lucia’s Day in Sweden shines a special light on the oldest girl in each family—literally! During the celebration, which occurs on December 13
as part of the Christmas season, she must dress in white and wear an illuminated crown to represent Lucia, an early Christian saint.
Sometimes she’ll serve special foods to family members. Boys get to join the fun, too, by wearing white and singing songs during parades.
