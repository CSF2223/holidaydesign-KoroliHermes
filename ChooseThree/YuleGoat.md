### Yule Goat, Scandinavia
You’ve likely heard of a Yule log, but how about a Yule goat? Throughout Scandinavia, especially Sweden, Norway and Finland,
locals celebrate a variation of the Santa Claus legend, which involves him riding a goat instead of a sleigh pulled by reindeer.
As such, it’s common to find goat ornaments everywhere. Although the town of Gävle, Sweden does one better by erecting a larger-than-life
straw goat in the town square (whose size has even made the Guinness Book of World Records). The goat structure is meant to last from
Advent until New Year’s Day, but perhaps more noteworthy than its size is the annual unofficial sabotaging of said goat, since it inevitably
gets burned to the ground more often than not.
