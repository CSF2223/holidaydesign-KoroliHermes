### Boxing Day

Christmas may get a lot of attention, but Boxing Day on December 26 is a major holiday in its own right. According to legend,
the holiday got its start when wealthy people in England brought food and other gifts to those who worked for them after Christmas.
That spirit of generosity remains, but the holiday has also evolved to be more festive.

In some places, like Canada, Hong Kong, and England, stores hold major sales on December 26, making it one of the year’s biggest days for shopping.
In the Bahamas, Boxing Day plays host to the Junkanoo festival, with a huge parade full of costumes and music. 

And Australia and New Zealand take advantage of the Southern Hemisphere’s summer weather by celebrating with big sporting events!
