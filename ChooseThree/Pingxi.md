### Pingxi Lantern Festival

Taiwan has a striking way of celebrating Lunar New Year: the Pingxi Lantern Festival. In the past, people in Taiwan used flying lanterns to signal
safety after bandit attacks. That hopeful spirit powers a celebration in which thousands of people write wishes onto special flying lanterns in the
village of Pingxi.

When the lanterns are lit, they float into the sky. Special regulations and Pingxi’s location between the mountains and the sea help keep the lanterns
contained safely, creating one of winter’s most remarkable sights.
