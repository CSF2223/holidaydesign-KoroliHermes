### St. Nicholas Day, Czech Republic
Nobody would blame you for not knowing the origin behind Santa Claus (other than the North Pole).
But he’s also called St. Nick for a reason: The jolly old man is actually based on St. Nicholas, a fourth-century Greek Bishop who protected children, among others.
St. Nicholas Day is still commonly celebrated across Europe on December 6th, though the traditions vary depending on the country.
In the Czech Republic, St. Nick dresses like a bishop and is accompanied by both an angel and a devil. Based on St. Nick’s judgment of a child’s behavior,
the kid either gets a treat from the angel or gets terrorized by the devil. Fun! Public festivities make Prague an excellent base to witness this spectacle,
with kids dressing as angels and devils.

### St. Nicholas Day, Netherlands
In a departure, St. Nicholas Day is celebrated on December 5th in the Netherlands, where St. Nick, or Sinterklaas, catches a steamboat from Spain. In preparation, kids leave traditional clogs (or just their regular shoes) by the fireplace or door. (Think of it as the equivalent of hanging stockings over the fireplace.) The shoes are filled with hay or carrots for Sinterklaas’ white horse, in the hopes that small gifts will replace this offering.
