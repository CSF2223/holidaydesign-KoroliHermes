### Thirteen Yule Lads, Iceland
The thirteen troll-like Yule Lads are like a mashup between Santa Claus and dwarves, since each has a different name and personality,
and each leaves gifts in children’s shoes for the 13 nights before Christmas. Unless kids are bad, in which case they get rotten potatoes,
or worse, the Yule Lads’ mom, Gryla, will boil them in a cauldron. The lads are a mischievous bunch, who mostly steal food and other items and slam doors.
For example, there’s the Pot Licker, who steals leftovers and then licks the pot clean, and the Skyr Gobbler, who has a penchant for stealing Icelandic yogurt.
But, these are small prices to pay for gifts.
