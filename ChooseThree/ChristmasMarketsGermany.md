### Christmas Markets, Germany
The earliest mention of Christmas markets can be traced to medieval Germany, although they likely appeared vastly different from today’s
sprawling affairs that often feature ice skating rinks and towering Christmas trees. Dresden holds the honor of being the oldest, and its
main one, Striezelmarkt, offers dozens of vendors, a carousel, Ferris wheel and puppet shows. Other famed markets can be found in Nuremberg,
Munich and Stuttgart. And while excellent Christmas markets now exist around the world, there’s no place like the original.
