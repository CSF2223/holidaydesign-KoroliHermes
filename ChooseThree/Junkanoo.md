### Junkanoo, Bahamas
Not to be confused with Carnival, a Catholic tradition associated with Lent, the immensely popular street festival called Junkanoo claims
different roots. Locals believe it evolved from an 18th-century tradition when slaves would celebrate having three days off during Christmas.
Today Junkanoo is celebrated on Dec. 26th and Jan. 1st and has advanced to the next level with a spectacular parade involving countless dance
troupes wearing elaborate costumes. Join thousands of onlookers at the main parade in Nassau, where it starts around 2 a.m. and goes until
about 10 a.m the following day. Not to fear, the contagious beat of drumming, cowbells and whistles will keep you going.
