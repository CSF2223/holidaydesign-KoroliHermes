### Sufganiyot, Israel
Sufganiyot, jelly-filled doughnuts topped with powdered sugar, are commonly enjoyed by Sephardic Jews (of Spanish, Middle Eastern and African origin)
during Hanukkah. The eight-day festival of lights in December (the date is different every year) celebrates a biblical event where one night of oil
lasted for eight, but it’s unknown exactly how or why sufganiyot became associated with the holiday. One theory is that both Moroccan and European Jews
enjoyed variations of the doughnuts before they became popular in Israel, where today they reign supreme during Hanukkah. Yet, it’s likely that the fried
component also had something to do with it, thanks to the oil, and really, what’s not to like about jelly-filled fried goodness?
