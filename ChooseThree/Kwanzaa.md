### Kwanzaa

Kwanzaa, a weeklong celebration of community and African culture, began with African Americans in the United States. Known for its
seven principles of unity (umoja), collective work and responsibility (ujima), cooperative economics (ujamaa), self-determination (kujichagulia),
purpose (nia), creativity (kuumba), and faith (imani), the holiday also places special significance on children.

Because children are the future of the community, they’re honored during Kwanzaa with gifts and encouraged to take important roles in celebrations.
They even helped give the holiday its name—Kwanzaa’s founders added an extra a to the Kiswahili word kwanza because seven children were involved
in the celebration’s early years!
