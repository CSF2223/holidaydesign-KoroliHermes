### Mummers Parade, Philadelphia
The longstanding Mummers Parade in Philadelphia is a beloved New Yearâ€™s Day tradition that first started in 1901. Costumed mimes who performed in
European plays during the Middle Ages were known as Mummers. Today, Mummers have evolved into numerous clubs that perform in the day-long parade,
with categories divided into those who play string instruments, comics, men dressed as women, the elaborately-costumed, and the elaborately-costumed
who perform short musical numbers. The last category is immensely popular. Officially called Fancy Brigades, they used to perform along Broad Street
along with the other groups, but today you have to buy tickets to watch them perform at the Philadelphia Convention Center.
