### Las Posadas, Mexico
Believed to have originated in Mexico via Spanish missionaries, Las Posadas (meaning inns), are nightly processionals for the nine days
proceeding Christmas Eve. The posadas recreate the tradition of Jesus and Mary seeking shelter and typically involve lots of singing and
children dressed as angels. Eventually, each posada ends the night at someone’s pre-selected home, where, after initially being turned away,
they’re welcomed with the likes of tamales and Christmas punch. The posada party isn’t over until the ceremonial whacking of the candy-filled piñata,
often a seven-pointed star representing the seven deadly sins that need to be smashed.
