### Roller Skating to Mass (Venezuela)

While Australians are surfing, Venezuelans are skating. It’s a long-running holiday tradition for the entire capital city of Caracas to roller skate
to early morning mass on Christmas Day. In fact, vehicles are banned from many parts of the city before 8 a.m. In case this form of transportation
isn’t strange enough, the night before kids will tie one end of a string to their big toe and hang the other end out of their bedroom window,
so passing roller skaters can give the string a friendly tug on their way to mass the next morning.
