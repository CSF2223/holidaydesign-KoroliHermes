# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS and RUBRIC

## Creativity
 - The primary purpose of a "freelance" project is to take what you have learned in the related walk-throughs and make it your own.
 - In this project you are asked to do the following:
     - Choose the text of exactly THREE holiday celebration text (markDown) files from all files provided in the "ChooseThree" folder of this repository.
     - Use the Image Gallery and Aladdin student portfolio walk-throughs as models to create YOUR own "original" Holiday Design CSS and HTML Zen static website. 
     - Establish your own HTML Structure AND CSS Styles following the guidelines stated in General Specifications below.
     - Your project should be **ONE page** only - thus not requiring a navigation menu.
     - Demonstrate your knowledge of **flex box** by utilizing this CSS tool in your project
     - Select your own colors / color palette
     - Select your own font(s)
     - Your images and external files should be stored in a folder titled "assets".
     - Adhere to any and all copyright concerns
     - Add one HTML or CSS feature that we have yet to use in our projects to date.
